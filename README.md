# "DOG" Ink adventure
Simple setup for an adventure game framework in the Ink scripting language.
Ink is typically used for "choose your own adventure" style stories, this is an example of how more advanced features like navigation, pathfinding, autonomous NPCs and inventory can be implemented.

The game is set in a small home that the player can explore at will. There's a food bowl that the player can fill with dog food, a water bowl that the player can fill with water, and a dog that gets hungry and thirsty and will seek out their food and water bowls when needed.
